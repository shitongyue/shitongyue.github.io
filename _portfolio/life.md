That is to meet one who is suitable in all aspects

Brave enough to live in this world with TA

To complete what you want to do and all unknown things

Have your own little life with TA

It's not the sun that wakes me up every morning

But TA cooks with TA

Cook for each other

Life is both petty bourgeoisie and exquisite

Work out with TA, run at night, ride at night and run a marathon

I don't want to see anything in the world,

I just want to live a good life with TA,

A life of two points and one line and a family of three with one cat

First make your life wonderful and then look forward to it,

Waiting for the arrival of that person

When TA and I have a stable job and income
